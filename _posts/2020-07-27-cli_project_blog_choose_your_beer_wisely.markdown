In my quest for a CLI project, not everything was nice and easy. In the very beginning I struggled to find a scrapable website. I had a couple of failed attempts at webistes such as Nintendo.com, or Stadia.com. The issue was that the websites were not giving me any elements back. Finally, I stumbled upon an easy scrapable website that had the promise of giving me just enough data to make my project.

BEHOLD! 

The Untappd CLI Project!

The project is based around untappd users rating the beers they have tried. Each beer contains a score and a number of ratings performed on the beer. The more raters and the higher the score, the more popular the beer is. This is then displayed in a curtailed list of the top 50 beers in the US. 

My CLI scrapes the top 50 beers and asks the user how he/she wants the information to be displayed. This can be done by beer name, beer style, or by brewery. This gives the user more flexibility in terms of how you go selecting the beers you want to try. Some might like a particular style, others want to support a local brewery, and others might just want to try something with a cool name.

After the information is displayed my CLI then shows a smaller list of the beers based on style or brewery. Finally, the user gets to choose one particular beer by name, and a more detailed list of beer attributes is presented. This list contains the popularity of the beer, the alcohol content, style, etc.

I must say the project was not as scary as I thought it to be at first. If I can recommend something would be to:

1. Go back to different lectures you have done and check the sample projects 
2. Join the CLI Project group on Slack (they are mostly quiet but if you ask something someone might help out)
3. Attend the OO and CLI study groups and talk to the instructors about your issue
4. Google problems
5. Start small and break down issues to smaller pieces
6. Chat me up! or anyone really... Make friends so that you can help each other out.


Best of luck!
