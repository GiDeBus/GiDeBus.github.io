For my Sinatra project I decided to build an app that can be a bit nostalgic during these pandemic times. The apps is called 'Places'; and as you probably guessed it, it tracks the places you have traveled to.

Building this project was not as time consuming and difficult as the CLI project in my experience. The main reason being that most of the framework to make the Sinatra app works has repeatedly been thrown at us in previous lectures as part of labs. This definitely allowed me to hit the ground running on how the project should have been structured.

If I may say, the hardest part was actually to build the connections from the start. This means setting up the `environment` and `config.ru` files as most of the times, these files are already setup for you in labs.

In terms of app funcionality, it covers what the main requirements were asking for: 

1- User needs to authenticate
2- One user cannot delete other user's places
3- `has_many`, and `belongs_to` relationships 
etc.

This is a project that I would definitely revisit even after completing the interview. I will like to further develop functionalities of the app, but we will see.
